    <div>
        <h3>By Road:</h3>
        
        Hatfield House is 21 miles from Central London, 7 miles North of the M25 motorway (junction 23) and 2 miles East of the A1(M) (junction 4). Exit the A1(M) at junction 4 (after the Hatfield Tunnel if travelling from the South) and follow the brown leisure signs for Hatfield House via the A414 and A1000. For Sat Nav please use AL9 5HX.
        
        <h3>By Bus or Train:</h3>
        
        The pedestrian entrance to Hatfield Park is opposite Hatfield railway station. The fast train from Kings Cross to Hatfield takes 20 minutes. There are London Underground links with this mainline at Finsbury Park (Piccadilly and Victoria lines). Local bus services regularly drop off at Hatfield railway station.

        Your presence is present enough, but if you would like to give a gift, cash gifts would be greatly appreciated.
